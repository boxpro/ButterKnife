== DEPLOYMENT METHODS
  = Starting
    Whenever you run the installer, we will check for the latest download of Toast. Because of this,
    you must start the installer with your computer connected to the Internet.

  = USB Drive
    USB Drive deployment requires a USB Drive to be used in order to deploy Toast.
    Start the utility with the USB Drive UNPLUGGED. When the installer asks, plug in your USB and
    hit enter. This will copy Toast's files to your USB drive (don't worry, we don't override anything).

    Next, unplug your USB and plug it into your RoboRIO. You should now connect to the same network as your
    RoboRIO. From here, the installer will connect to your RoboRIO and finish the installation.

  = USB Tether
    The easiest and quickest of the 3 methods. Simply plug your RoboRIO into your computer using the included
    USB cable. The installer will take care of everything else.

  = Network
    This method doesn't require a USB Drive OR a USB Cable, just a network connection to the RoboRIO (using
    the WiFi modem). Connect to your RoboRIO's network and the installer will take care of deployment for you
